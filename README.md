# PeerCode
  PeerCode — Real-time Collaborative Code Editor with Sandboxed Runner

PeerCode is a collaborative coding platform that lets multiple users **edit code in real time (CRDT-powered)**, run it in **secure ephemeral sandboxes**, and **replay sessions** for training, interviews, and team collaboration.  

This project demonstrates **real-world engineering depth**:  
- Real-time collaboration (Yjs + WebSockets)  
- Secure containerized execution environments  
- CRDT-based conflict resolution  
- Session recording & replay  
- AI-assisted feedback (planned)  

---

##  Features
- **Real-time code editing** — powered by CRDTs (Yjs), multiple users edit simultaneously without conflicts.  
- **Presence indicators** — see collaborator cursors & usernames live.  
- **Sandboxed code execution** — Docker containers with CPU/memory limits, streamed logs.  
- **Session recording & replay** — watch collaborative sessions like a video.  
- **Multi-language support** — JavaScript & Python (MVP).  
- **AI-assisted code review (planned)** — automated feedback & hints.

##  Architecture

### High-level overview
- **Frontend (React + TypeScript)** — Monaco editor, CRDT sync, replay UI  
- **Realtime Gateway (Node.js + WebSocket)** — handles Yjs document sync & presence  
- **Sandbox Runner (Docker + Redis queue)** — spins up ephemeral containers for code execution  
- **Backend API (NestJS/Express)** — auth, sessions, replay storage  
- **Storage** — PostgreSQL (users/sessions), Redis (queue/state), S3 (session replays)
